  <p>My first venture into web development was when I needed to write a custom script for a Wordpress website. I instantly was hooked. From that point I began to learn web development and eventually object oriented programming and software development.</p>
  <p>I have been involved in many web projects, as well as hybrid mobile and desktop apps, progressive web apps, and video games. I love programming because of the new challenges and creative solutions to problems that it provides.</p>
  <p>My skillset includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>TypeScript</li>
    <li>JSX</li>
    <li>CSS,SASS,LESS</li>
    <li>Ionic</li>
    <li>Cordova</li>
    <li>Angular</li>
    <li>Firebase</li>
  </ul>
